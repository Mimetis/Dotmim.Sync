Progression
=====================

| Getting useful information during a sync process could be complex.
| You can have a lot of information from an in-going sync, through two kinds of things:

* ``IProgress<ProgressArgs>`` : A best practice using `IProgress<T> <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.progress-1>`_ to handle progress from within an *awaitable* method.
* ``ÃŒnterceptor<T>`` : A more advanced technic to handle a lot of more events from within **DMS**

Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^

During a full synchronization, we have **two distincts** progression:

* A first **Progression** from the client side
* A second **Progression** from the server side.

We have a lot of progress values raised from both the **server** and the **client** side:

* Each progress value is catched at the end of a method called by the **Orchestrator** instance.
* Each progress value in a sync process corresponds to a specific *stage*, represented by a ``SyncStage`` enumeration.

.. code-block:: csharp

    public enum SyncStage
    {
        None,
        // Sync start and ends
        BeginSession,
        EndSession,

        // Loading metadatas
        ScopeLoading,
        ScopeLoaded,

        // Creating a snapshot on the server side
        SnapshotCreating,
        SnapshotCreated,

        // Applying a snapshot on the client side
        SnapshotApplying,
        SnapshotApplied,

        // Reading a schema
        SchemaReading,
        SchemaRead,

        // Provisioning a schema (tables / stored proc / triggers / tracking tables)
        Provisioning,
        Provisioned,

        // Deprovisioning a schema
        Deprovisioning,
        Deprovisioned,

        // Selecting changes to apply to the server or client
        ChangesSelecting,
        ChangesSelected,

        // Applying changes to the server or client
        ChangesApplying,
        ChangesApplied,

        // Cleaning tracking information from any tracking table
        MetadataCleaning,
        MetadataCleaned,

        // Migrating a setup to a new one
        Migrating,
        Migrated,
    }

To explain how things work, we are starting from a really straightforward sync process example, using the sample from `Hello sync sample <https://github.com/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/blob/master/Samples/HelloSync>`_:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var serverProvider = new SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider(serverConnectionString);
    var clientProvider = new SqlSyncProvider(clientConnectionString);

    var tables = new string[] {"ProductCategory", "ProductModel", "Product",
                "Address", "Customer", "CustomerAddress", "SalesOrderHeader", 
                "SalesOrderDetail" };

    var agent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, serverProvider, tables);
    do
    {
        // Launch the sync process
        var s1 = await agent.SynchronizeAsync();
        // Write results
        Console.WriteLine(s1);

    } while (Console.ReadKey().Key != ConsoleKey.Escape);

    Console.WriteLine("End");

We are going to see how to get useful information, from each stage involved during the sync processus, thanks to ``IProgress<T>`` and then we will go deeper with the notion of ``Interceptor<T>``.

.. hint:: You will find this complete sample here : `Progression sample <https://github.com/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/tree/master/Samples/Progression>`_ 

IProgress\<T\>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we said, the progress values are triggered from both side : **Server** side and **Client** side, ordered.  

In our sample, we can say that : 

* The ``RemoteOrchestrator`` instance, using the server provider instance, will report all the progress from the server side.   
* The ``LocalOrchestrator`` instance using the client provider instance, will report all the progress from the client side.  

.. note:: The ``syncAgent`` instance will report progress **only** from the **Client** side.
          
          Why? Because the ``syncAgent`` instance is always running **locally** on the client local machine, and the **server** may be is behind an **HTTP** endpoint. Then ``syncAgent`` has no idea what's going on the server side.

.. hint:: A ``syncAgent`` object is **always** running on the client side of **any** architecture.  

Since our main method ``SynchronizeAsync()`` is marked ``async`` method, we will use the `Progress\<T\> <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.progress-1?view=netcore-2.2>`_ to be able to report progress value.

So far, the most straightforward way to get feedback from a current sync, is to pass an instance of ``Progress<T>`` when calling the method ``SynchronizeAsync()``.

.. note:: ``Progress<T>`` is **not** synchronous. So far, no guarantee that the progress callbacks will be raised in an ordered way.   
          
          That's why you can use a **DMS** progess class called ``SynchronousProgress<T>`` which is synchronous, using the correct synchronization context.

Here is a quick example used to provide some feedback to the user:   

.. code-block:: csharp

    var serverProvider = new SqlSyncChangeTrackingProvider(serverConnectionString);
    var clientProvider = new SqlSyncProvider(clientConnectionString);

    // Tables involved in the sync process:
    var tables = new string[] {"ProductCategory", "ProductModel", "Product",
        "Address", "Customer", "CustomerAddress", "SalesOrderHeader", "SalesOrderDetail" };

    // Creating an agent that will handle all the process
    var agent = new SyncAgent(clientProvider, serverProvider, tables);

    // Using the IProgress<T> pattern to handle progession dring the synchronization
    var progress = new SynchronousProgress<ProgressArgs>(args => 
            Console.WriteLine('$'"{args.Context.SyncStage}:{args.Message}"));

    do
    {
        // Launch the sync process
        var s1 = await agent.SynchronizeAsync(progress);
        // Write results
        Console.WriteLine(s1);

    } while (Console.ReadKey().Key != ConsoleKey.Escape);

    Console.WriteLine("End");


Here is the result, after the first synchronization, assuming the **Client** database is empty:


.. code-block:: bash

    BeginSession:   22:27:06.811
    ScopeLoaded:    22:27:07.215     [Client] [DefaultScope] [Version ] Last sync: Last sync duration:0:0:0.0
    Provisioned:    22:27:09.140     [Client] tables count:8 provision:Table, TrackingTable, StoredProcedures, Triggers
    ChangesSelected:        22:27:09.207     [Client] upserts:0 deletes:0 total:0
    ChangesApplying:        22:27:09.786     [Client] [ProductCategory] Modified applied:41 resolved conflicts:0

    ChangesApplying:        22:27:10.124     [Client] [CustomerAddress] Modified applied:417 resolved conflicts:0
    ChangesApplying:        22:27:10.164     [Client] [SalesOrderHeader] Modified applied:32 resolved conflicts:0
    ChangesApplying:        22:27:10.218     [Client] [SalesOrderDetail] Modified applied:542 resolved conflicts:0
    ChangesApplied: 22:27:10.268     [Client] applied:2752 resolved conflicts:0
    EndSession:     22:27:10.269
    Synchronization done.
            Total changes  uploaded: 0
            Total changes  downloaded: 2752
            Total changes  applied: 2752
            Total resolved conflicts: 0
            Total duration :0:0:3.463


As you can see, it's a first synchronization, so:

* Session begins 
* Client apply databases schema for all tables
* Client select changes to send (nothing, obviously, because the tables have just been created on the client)
* Client applies changes from server 
* Session ends

Since the agent is executing on the client, as we said, the ``progress`` instance reference passed to the ``agent.SynchronizeAsync(progress)`` will trigger all the progress from the client side only.   

To be able to get progress from the server side (if you are not in a web proxy mode), you can call the ``AddRemoteProgress()`` method with your `remoteProgress` instance.

.. code-block:: csharp

    // I want the server side progress as well
    var remoteProgress = new SynchronousProgress<ProgressArgs>(s =>
    {
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
        Console.WriteLine('$'"{s.Context.SyncStage}:\t{s.Message}");
        Console.ResetColor();
    });
    agent.AddRemoteProgress(remoteProgress);


The result is really verbose, but you have ALL the informations  from both **Client** side and **Server** side !

Interceptor\<T\>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Progress<T>`` stuff is great, but as we said, it's mainly read only, and the progress is always reported **at the end of a current sync stage**.   

| So, if you need a more granular control on all the progress values, you can subscribe to an ``Interceptor<T>``.   
| On each **orchestrator**, you will find a lot of relevant methods to intercept the sync process, encapsulate in a fancy ``OnMethodAsync()`` method:

.. image:: assets/interceptor01.png


Imagine you have a table that should **never** be synchronized. You're able to use an interceptor like this:

.. code-block:: csharp

    // We are using a cancellation token that will be passed as an argument 
    // to the SynchronizeAsync() method !
    var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

    agent.LocalOrchestrator.OnTableChangesApplying((args) =>
    {
        if (args.SchemaTable.TableName == "Table_That_Should_Not_Be_Sync")
            cts.Cancel();
    });

Be careful, your ``CancellationTokenSource`` instance will rollback the whole sync session and you will get a ``SyncException`` error ! 

Intercepting rows
------------------------------------------------------

| You may want to intercept all the rows that have just been selected from the source (client or server), and are about to be sent to their destination (server or client).   
| Or even intercept all the rows that are going to be applied on a destination database.   
| That way, you may be able to modify these rows, to meet your business / requirements rules.  

To do so, you can use the **interceptors** ``OnTableChangesSelecting`` and ``OnTableChangesSelected`` to have more details on what changes are selected for each table.

In the other hand, you can use the **interceptors** ``OnTableChangesApplying`` and ``OnTableChangesApplied`` to get all the rows that will be applied to a destination database.


.. hint:: You will find the sample used for this chapter, here : `Spy sample <https://github.com/Mimetis/Dotmim.Sync/tree/master/Samples/Spy>`_. 


.. code-block:: csharp

    // Intercept a table changes selecting stage.
    agent.LocalOrchestrator.OnTableChangesSelecting(args =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine('$'"-- Getting changes from table {args.Table.GetFullName()} ...");
    });

    // Intercept a table changes applying stage, with a particular state [Upsert] or [Deleted]
    // The rows included in the args.Changes table will be applied right after.
    agent.LocalOrchestrator.OnTableChangesApplying(args =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine('$'"-- Applying changes {args.State} to table {args.Changes.GetFullName()}");

        if (args.Changes == null || args.Changes.Rows.Count == 0)
            return;

        foreach (var row in args.Changes.Rows)
            Console.WriteLine(row);
    });

    // Intercept a table changes selected stage.
    // The rows included in the args.Changes have been selected 
    // from the local database and will be sent to the server.
    agent.LocalOrchestrator.OnTableChangesSelected(args =>
    {
        if (args.Changes == null || args.Changes.Rows.Count == 0)
            return;

        foreach (var row in args.Changes.Rows)
            Console.WriteLine(row);
    });
